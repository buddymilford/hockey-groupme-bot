# hockey-groupme-bot
GroupMe bot built with NodeJS that sends a daily message if there is a St. Louis Blues game today

## Getting started: ##
* After creating a GroupMe account, go to https://dev.groupme.com/session/new
* Click 'Create Bot'
* Select the Group it will 'live' in, and give it a name. (Feel free to add a photo for the bot's avatar. A callback URL isn't necessary for this bot, so leave that input field blank).

## Changing Teams: ##
* The program reads comma seperated values from Schedule.csv
  Since I am a St. Louis Blues fan, this file currently only has St. Louis Blues games
* I have included 2016_2017_NHL_Schedule.csv which contains every NHL game this season
* From the command line
    rm Schedule.csv
    grep 'Your Team Name Here' 2016_2017_NHL_Schedule.csv >> Schedule.csv
* This removes the old schedule file, and creates a new schedule file
* ***!IMPORTANT: 
  The final step is to open your new Schedule.csv file in your favorite text editor,
  Insert this in a new line at the very top: ***
    DATE,TIME,AWAY,HOME
* Your Schedule.csv file with your favorite hockey team is now compatible with the JavaScript

## Running the program: ##
  node main.js
  (obviously you must have node installed)

Customization:
* Feel free to change the time of node-schedule's reccurrence
